From counting the cells manually, with a bit of knowledge:

* 5 min google research about what a nucleus is
* Looking at 2 or 3 google images of textbook examples of nucleii
* One or two scientific articles about Ethidium Bromide (probably the stuff used in the images)
* Just overall highschool-grade biolgy

General method:
* Consider that a glob of relatively-fluorescent material (red channel) is a nucleus
* Brighter spots inside a glob are ot new nucleii, just the nucleus core
* Nucleii don't naturally form "hourglass" shapes, so if there is such a shape i consider there are 2 nucleii close together.
